# Sample application: Nop

This directory contains a source tree for a simple application that attempts to do nothing well.


## Test purpose

To provide a baseline application that builds with an unembellished Autotool framework.


## Definition of original application

The file `src/Makefile.am` was written by hand.

The file `configure.ac` was generated by running `autoscan`.

The file `README` is a soft-link of `README.md`, as a middle-ground between Autotools requiring the file `README` to exist, and for text editor niceties (Markdown syntax highlighting) and Github presentation.
