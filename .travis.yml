# The purpose of declaring this a java project to Travis is to make use of Travis tools available to Java environments, to assist with running swidval for swidtag validation.
# Otherwise, the project is much more based on Autotools on C toy projects.
# JDK 8 is used because of an outstanding issue on JDK 10.0.1+ with swidval.
